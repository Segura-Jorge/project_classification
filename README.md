# Telco Churn Classification Project

## Project Description
This project delves into the data from the company Telco. The primary objective is to predict customer churn. Through exploratory data analysis, we will delve deep into the dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and factors leading to customer churn.

## Project Goal
The overarching goal of this project is to decipher patterns within the available data that can aid in preventing customer churn. This will be achieved through the use of various modeling techniques and testing classification modules to pinpoint the major churn triggers.

## Initial Thoughts
One preliminary hypothesis that might play a crucial role in customer churn is related to monetary factors. Whether it's the pricing of the services, hidden charges, or related financial constraints, there might be significant monetary elements influencing the churn.

## The Plan
The entire project is structured in the following sequential phases:

1. **Planning**: Blueprint the roadmap and chalk out strategies.
2. **Acquire Data**: Retrieve relevant datasets and raw information.
3. **Prepare Data**: Clean, preprocess, and structure the data for analysis.
4. **Explore Data**: Engage in deep exploratory data analysis to unearth patterns and correlations.
5. **Model**: Build, train, and validate models that can predict customer churn.
6. **Deliver**: Present the findings, actionable insights, and recommendations.

## Takeaways and Conclusions

### Exploration
* There IS a relationship between churn and whether they are or not senior citizen.
* There IS a relationship between churn and not having internet service.
* There IS a relationship between churn and customers who pay with credit card.
### Modeling
**The final model increased the accuracy of predicting Telco customers who would churn by 6.4%.**
* In this case, I want to know what features are most dependable for figuring out what led to churn in Telco. I have made a lot of progress in this regard but I certainly still have directions to run.

## Recommendations
- Consider offering longer service plans/contracts at a marginally higher fixed price to avoid customer churn.
- Consider offering a promotion to those customers who pay with credit card.
